## Before you push

- Make sure all of your raw data is in a /data directory, which will be ignored by the .gitignore. 

## Useful Resources

- Alex is compiling notes on the dataset [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RDn2c__tK9fXHaKOiJ9LlYXyq3h576KojI-qgLzyEN4/edit?usp=sharing).
- [This website](https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2013-2017/) lists NYState's preventative health improvement agenda. 

## Structure

- The 'folext' folder is a small extension to the folium visualization library for interactive mapping. If you don't already have geopandas or folium installed, I wouldn't worry about using it.
